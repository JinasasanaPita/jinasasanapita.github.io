                        This console project is on of the first project I worked on since coming out of 2 years of national service. Although a project in console might seem 
                        trivial and simple at first glance, it defines and further root my understanding in C++, one of the most powerful languages in modern programming.

                </br>
                    <p>Several modern key programming techniques were used in the development of this project, including practices of clean code and SOLID principles introduced by 
                        Robert C. Martin as well as test-driven-development (TDD) introduced by Kent Beck.

                    <p>My time with Imme VR was a fruitful one. During my time there, I was mainly working on developing VR/AR solutions for real estate agents and interior 
                        design companies, allowing them to more efficiently showcase their properties and products. 
                    </p>
                </br>
                    <p>Leading a small team, we proposed AR/VR solutions that included the workings of computer vision, something that was booming even within the AI industry. 
                        This experience with Imme VR and the opportunities that they have given me has opened my eyes to what is possible and what is being done around the 
                        entrepreunial tech industry.

                        compute time. The project will be done in context of a very popular MMORPG, Final Fantasy XIV. In this project, we will try to detect if a button is
